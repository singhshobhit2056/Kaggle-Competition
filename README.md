## Customer Churn in Banking

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses, including the banking industry. It refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their 
relationship with a company, indicating a departure from using its products or services. In the context of banking, churn occurs when customers close their accounts or discontinue 
utilizing various financial services provided by the bank.

Predicting and understanding customer churn is of paramount importance for financial institutions. It enables banks to proactively identify potential churners, allowing them to 
implement targeted strategies for customer retention. The ability to forecast churn empowers banks to take preventive measures, such as offering personalized incentives, improving 
customer service, or introducing new features to retain valued clients.
